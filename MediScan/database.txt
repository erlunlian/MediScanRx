Treatment for necrosis generally    consisted of a combination of nitroglycerin ointment/vasodilatation, ibuprofen,    acetaminophen, or aspirin, antibiotics, steroids, non-steroidal wound treatment    ointment and warm compresses. For cases where information was available,    patients had recovered or were recovering with minimal to no scarring at last    contact. Few cases required consultation with a plastic surgeon and possible    excision and revision surgery to correct the defect resulting from the    necrosis.,Allergic Reaction was identified by itchiness and severe    swelling, including swelling of the face and tongue. Onset ranged from    immediately after injection to 2 days after injection. Allergic reaction was    generally treated with anti-histamines and steroids. Some cases required    hospitalization. All patients recovered from the allergic reaction with no    permanent adverse outcome.,Serious edema has been reported with an onset ranging    from 1 day to 3 weeks (inflammation related to nodule formation). Treatment    generally consisted of administration of antibiotics, anti-histamines and    steroids. In some cases patients sought treatment in an emergency room or were    hospitalized. Generally events resolved within 1 to 2 days but a few patients    have been reported as having intermittent edema or persistent edema related to    a reoccurring infection. For cases where information was available, most    patients have recovered or are recovering.,Infection, often identified as cellulitis, was    accompanied by swelling, hardened areas, redness, pustules, and pain. Onset of    infection ranged from 1 day to 2 months and generally lasted 2 days but, in one    case, persisted for 6 months. Infections were generally treated with    antibiotics. For cases where information was available, patients had recovered or    were recovering.

There were no reports of deaths, life-threatening events, or adverseevents that led to discontinuation or withdrawal from the study. Four subjectsreceived FXIII in the peri-operative setting, and no treatment-related AEs werereported. An additional subject was pre-treated with plasma and experienced ahypersensitivity reaction.ImmunogenicityA case of neutralizing antibodies against FXIII wasreported in the postmarketing clinical study. The patient received prophylactictreatment with Corifact for ten years. Concomitant medications included interferonfor hepatitis C infection. This patient presented with bruising, andpost-infusion FXIII levels were found to be lower than expected. Over severalweeks, FXIII recovery values decreased, so the dose and frequency of treatmentswere increased. Neutralizing antibodies to FXIII were detected, interferontreatment was discontinued, and the subject underwent plasmapheresis. Within amonth, neutralizing antibodies were no longer detectable, FXIII recovery levelsimproved, and the previous prophylactic regimen was resumed.        Read the entire FDA prescribing information for Corifact (Factor XIII Concentrate (Human) Lyophilized Powder Reconstitution for Intravenous Use)Read More »                                    Take the Blood Disorders Quiz                    Anemia Symptoms, Causes, Types, and Treatment                    Picture of Pernicious Anemia                                                                                     Related Resources for Corifact                                                                        Related Drugs        Advate,Adynovate,Bebulin VH,BeneFIX	empty

There were no reports of deaths, life-threatening events, or adverseevents that led to discontinuation or withdrawal from the study. Four subjectsreceived FXIII in the peri-operative setting, and no treatment-related AEs werereported. An additional subject was pre-treated with plasma and experienced ahypersensitivity reaction.ImmunogenicityA case of neutralizing antibodies against FXIII wasreported in the postmarketing clinical study. The patient received prophylactictreatment with Corifact for ten years. Concomitant medications included interferonfor hepatitis C infection. This patient presented with bruising, andpost-infusion FXIII levels were found to be lower than expected. Over severalweeks, FXIII recovery values decreased, so the dose and frequency of treatmentswere increased. Neutralizing antibodies to FXIII were detected, interferontreatment was discontinued, and the subject underwent plasmapheresis. Within amonth, neutralizing antibodies were no longer detectable, FXIII recovery levelsimproved, and the previous prophylactic regimen was resumed.        Read the entire FDA prescribing information for Corifact (Factor XIII Concentrate (Human) Lyophilized Powder Reconstitution for Intravenous Use)Read More »                                    Take the Blood Disorders Quiz                    Anemia Symptoms, Causes, Types, and Treatment                    Picture of Pernicious Anemia                                                                                     Related Resources for Corifact                                                                        Related Drugs        Advate,Adynovate,Bebulin VH,BeneFIX	empty

The safety analyses included 49 subjects in theintention-to-treat (ITT) population. The ITT population consisted of all subjectswho received at least one dose of Hizentra [see Clinical Studies].Subjects were treated with Hizentra at weekly mediandoses ranging from 66 to 331 mg/kg body weight (mean: 181.4 mg/kg) during thewash-in/wash-out period and from 72 to 379 mg/kg (mean: 213.2 mg/kg) during theefficacy period. The 49 subjects received a total of 2264 weekly infusions ofHizentra.Table 2 summarizes the most frequent adverse reactions(ARs) (experienced by at least 2 subjects) occurring during or within 72 hoursafter the end of an infusion. Local reactions were assessed by theinvestigators 15 to 45 minutes post-infusion and by the subjects 24 hourspost-infusion. The investigators then evaluated the ARs arising from thesubject assessments. Local reactions were the most frequent ARs observed, withinjection-site reactions (e.g., swelling, redness, heat, pain, and itching atthe site of injection) comprising 98% of local reactions.Table 2: Incidence of Subjects with Adverse Reactions(ARs)* (Experienced by 2 or More Subjects) and Rate per Infusion (ITTPopulation), US Study        AR ( ≥ 2 Subjects)    ARs* Occurring During or    Within 72 Hours of Infusion        Number (%) of Subjects          (n=49)    Number (Rate*) of ARs (n=2264 Infusions)        Local reactions‡    49    (100)    1322    (0.584)        Other ARs:            Headache    12 (24.5)    32 (0.014)          Diarrhea    5 (10.2)    6 (0.003)          Fatigue    4 (8.2)    4 (0.002)          Back pain    4 (8.2)    5 (0.002)          Nausea    4 (8.2)    4 (0.002)          Pain in    extremity    4 (8.2)    6 (0.003)          Cough    4 (8.2)    4 (0.002)          Vomiting    3 (6.1)    3 (0.001)          Abdominal    pain, upper    3 (6.1)    3 (0.001)          Migraine    3 (6.1)    4 (0.002)          Pain    3 (6.1)    4 (0.002)          Arthralgia    2 (4.1)    3 (0.001)          Contusion    2 (4.1)    3 (0.001)          Rash    2 (4.1)    3 (0.001)          Urticaria    2 (4.1)    2 ( <  0.001)        * Excluding infections.† Rate of ARs per infusion.‡ Includes injection-site reactions as well as bruising, scabbing, pain,irritation, cysts, eczema, and nodules at the injection site.    The ratio of infusions with ARs, including localreactions, to all infusions was 1303 to 2264 (57.6%). Excluding localreactions, the corresponding ratio was 56 to 2264 (2.5%).Table 3 summarizes injection-site reactions based oninvestigator assessments 15 to 45 minutes after the end of the 683 infusionsadministered during regularly scheduled visits (every 4 weeks).Table 3: Investigator Assessments* of Injection-SiteReactions by Infusion, US Study        Injection-Site Reaction    Number† (Rate‡) of Reactions (n=683 Infusions§)        Edema/induration    467    (0.68)        Erythema    346 (0.51)        Local    heat    108 (0.16)        Local    pain    88 (0.13)        Itching    64 (0.09)        * 15 to 45 minutes after the end of infusionsadministered at regularly scheduled visits (every 4 weeks).† For multiple injection sites, every site was judged, but only the site withthe strongest reaction was recorded.‡ Rate of injection-site reactions per infusion.§ Number of infusions administered during regularly scheduled visits.    Most local reactions were either mild (93.4%) or moderate(6.3%) in intensity.No deaths or serious ARs occurred during the study. Twosubjects withdrew from the study due to ARs. One subject experienced a severeinjection-site reaction one day after the third weekly infusion, and the othersubject experienced moderate myositis. Both reactions were judged to be “atleast possibly related” to the administration of Hizentra.European StudyIn a clinical study conducted in Europe, the safety ofHizentra was evaluated for 10 months (3-month wash-in/wash-out period followedby a 7-month efficacy period) in 51 subjects with PI who had been treatedpreviously with IGIV every 3 or 4 weeks or with IGSC weekly. Subjects weretreated with Hizentra at weekly median doses ranging from 59 to 267 mg/kg bodyweight (mean: 118.8 mg/kg) during the wash-in/wash-out period and from 59 to243 mg/kg (mean: 120.1 mg/kg) during the efficacy period. The 51 subjectsreceived a total of 1831 weekly infusions of Hizentra.Table 4 summarizes the most frequent ARs (experienced byat least 2 subjects) occurringduring or within 72 hours after the end of aninfusion. Local reactions were assessed by the subjects between 24 and 72 hourspost-infusion. The investigators then evaluated the ARs arising from thesubject assessments.Table 4: Incidence of Subjects with Adverse Reactions(ARs)* (Experienced by 2 or More Subjects) and Rate per Infusion, EuropeanStudy        AR ( ≥ 2    Subjects)    ARs* Occurring During or    Within 72 Hours of Infusion        Number    (%) of Subjects      (n=51)    Number    (Ratet) of ARs      (n=1831    Infusions)        Local reactions‡    24    (47.1)    105    (0.057)        Other ARs:             Headache    9    (17.6)    20    (0.011)          Rash    4 (7.8)    4 (0.002)          Pruritus    4 (7.8)    13 (0.007)          Fatigue    3 (5.9)    5 (0.003)          Abdominal    pain, upper    2 (3.9)    3 (0.002)          Arthralgia    2 (3.9)    2 (0.001)          Erythema    2 (3.9)    4 (0.002)          Abdominal    discomfort    2 (3.9)    3 (0.002)          Back pain    2 (3.9)    2 (0.001)          Hematoma    2 (3.9)    3 (0.002)          Hypersensitivity    2 (3.9)    4 (0.002)        * Excluding infections.† Rate of ARs per infusion.‡ Includes infusion-related reaction; infusion-site mass;infusion/injection-site erythema, hematoma, induration, inflammation, edema,pain, pruritus, rash, reaction, swelling; injection-site extravasation, nodule;puncture-site reaction.    The proportion of subjects reporting local reactionsdecreased over time from approximately 20% following the first infusion to < 5% by the end of the study.Three subjects withdrew from the study due to ARs of mildto moderate intensity. One subject experienced injection-site pain andinjection-site pruritus; the second subject experienced injection-site reaction,fatigue, and feeling cold; and the third subject experienced injection-sitereaction and hypersensitivity. All reactions were judged by the investigator tobe “at least possibly related” to the administration of Hizentra.Biweekly (Every Two Weeks) Or Frequent (2 To 7 Times per  Week) DosingNo data regarding ARs are available for these alternativeHizentra dosing regimens because no clinical trials using these regimens wereconducted; however, it is unlikely that the safety profile is qualitativelydifferent from that of weekly dosing.Postmarketing ExperienceBecause postmarketing reporting of adverse reactionsis voluntary and from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possibleto reliably estimate the frequency of these reactions or establish a causalrelationship to product exposure.HizentraThe following adverse reactions have been identifiedduring postmarketing use of Hizentra.This list does not include reactionsalready reported in clinical studies with Hizentra [see Clinical Trials Experience above].  Infusion reactions: Allergic-anaphylactic reactions such    as swollen face or tongue and pharyngeal edema, pyrexia, chills, dizziness,    hypertension/changes in blood pressure, malaise.,Cardiovascular: Chest discomfort (including chest    pain),Respiratory: Dyspnea,Neurological: Tremor, burning sensation	empty

Hyaluronic Acid Dermal Filler Gel (Restylane)	Hypersensitivity reactions ranging from moderate to    severe mostly occurred within 1 to 2 days of implantation and up to 3 weeks.    Reported symptoms included swelling; itching on chest and back; puffy, burning,    watery, and itchy eyes; and shortness of breath. Treatments included steroids, diphenhydramine,    unspecified intravenous medication, oxygen and various creams. An evaluation of    patients who reported potential hypersensitivity reactions did not demonstrate any    evidence of IgE or cell mediated immunologic reactions specifically directed at    hyaluronic acid. Most hypersensitivity events resolved within 1 to 14 days with    or without treatment.,Allergic reaction and anaphylactic shock: Eight patients    experienced immediate post-injection reactions which included extreme swelling    of lips and the whole face. Two of these patients had symptoms of hypersensitivity    and one patient experienced anaphylactic shock and presented with shortness of    breath, headache, nausea and vomiting. These patients had to be admitted to the    emergency room or were hospitalized for immediate medical interventions. Delayed      hypersensitivity: Two patients developed symptoms of hypersensitivity 7-10    days after injection. One patient experienced severe erythema and swelling in    the lips and all over her face to the point that her eyes were shut and the    other had swelling of the lips accompanied by dyspnea, lymphadenopathy,    peripheral and laryngeal edema.,Vascular accidents and necrosis: In 5 patients, skin    discoloration, bruising, and blanching was seen immediately post-injection due    to vascular accidents. The lesions later turned into necrosis and in some cases    remained as scarring or dark spots. One example was a patient who had a “mustache-like”    mark above her lips, even after receiving treatments. Later, one patient in    this group developed hard bumps in her upper lips that looked like  “granulomas.”,Infection/Abscess: Serious abscess formations ranging    from moderate to severe occurred in eleven patients. Onset ranged from 3 days    to one week with an average duration of approximately one month to resolution.    Symptoms included swelling, redness, pain and hard nodules. Five patients    required hospitalization for incision and drainage (I&D) and intravenous    (IV) antibiotic therapy. Cultures for all patients ranged from gram positive    staphylococcal, gram negative cellulitis, apathogen streptococci, gram positive    cocci infection, polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) with no bacteria and    positive proprionibacterium malassezia. The remaining cultures were either negative    or not reported. Treatment included various antibiotics and steroids in some    cases.	empty
Hyaluronic Acid Dermal Filler Injectable Gel with 0.3% Lidocaine (Restylane-L)	Hypersensitivity reactions ranging from moderate to    severe mostly occurred within 1 to 2 days of implantation and up to 3 weeks.    Reported symptoms included swelling; itching on chest and back; puffy, burning,    watery, and itchy eyes; and shortness of breath. Treatments included steroids, diphenhydramine,    unspecified intravenous medication, oxygen and various creams. An evaluation of    patients who reported potential hypersensitivity reactions did not demonstrate    any evidence of IgE or cell mediated immunologic reactions specifically    directed at hyaluronic acid. Most hypersensitivity events resolved within 1 to    14 days with or without treatment.,Allergic reaction and anaphylactic shock: Eight    patients experienced immediate post-injection reactions which included extreme    swelling of lips and the whole face. Two of these patients had symptoms of hypersensitivity    and one patient experienced anaphylactic shock and presented with shortness of    breath, headache, nausea and vomiting. These patients had to be admitted to the    emergency room or were hospitalized for immediate medical interventions. Delayed    hypersensitivity: Two patients developed symptoms of hypersensitivity 7-10 days    after injection. One patient experienced severe erythema and swelling in the    lips and all over her face to the point that her eyes were shut and the other had    swelling of the lips accompanied by dyspnea, lymphadenopathy, peripheral and    laryngeal edema.,Vascular accidents and necrosis: In 5 patients,    skin discoloration, bruising, and blanching was seen immediately post-injection    due to vascular accidents. The lesions later turned into necrosis and in some cases    remained as scarring or dark spots. One example was a patient who had a  “mustache-like” mark above her lips, even after receiving treatments. Later,    one patient in this group developed hard bumps in her upper lips that looked    like “granulomas.”,Infection/Abscess: Serious abscess formations ranging    from moderate to severe occurred in eleven patients. Onset ranged from 3 days    to one week with an average duration of approximately one month to resolution.    Symptoms included swelling, redness, pain and hard nodules. Five patients    required hospitalization for incision and drainage (I&D) and intravenous    (IV) antibiotic therapy. Cultures for all patients ranged from gram positive    staphylococcal, gram negative cellulitis, apathogen streptococci, gram positive    cocci infection, polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) with no bacteria and    positive proprionibacterium malassezia. The remaining cultures were either    negative or not reported. Treatment included various antibiotics and steroids in    some cases.	empty

The safety analyses included 49 subjects in theintention-to-treat (ITT) population. The ITT population consisted of all subjectswho received at least one dose of Hizentra [see Clinical Studies].Subjects were treated with Hizentra at weekly mediandoses ranging from 66 to 331 mg/kg body weight (mean: 181.4 mg/kg) during thewash-in/wash-out period and from 72 to 379 mg/kg (mean: 213.2 mg/kg) during theefficacy period. The 49 subjects received a total of 2264 weekly infusions ofHizentra.Table 2 summarizes the most frequent adverse reactions(ARs) (experienced by at least 2 subjects) occurring during or within 72 hoursafter the end of an infusion. Local reactions were assessed by theinvestigators 15 to 45 minutes post-infusion and by the subjects 24 hourspost-infusion. The investigators then evaluated the ARs arising from thesubject assessments. Local reactions were the most frequent ARs observed, withinjection-site reactions (e.g., swelling, redness, heat, pain, and itching atthe site of injection) comprising 98% of local reactions.Table 2: Incidence of Subjects with Adverse Reactions(ARs)* (Experienced by 2 or More Subjects) and Rate per Infusion (ITTPopulation), US Study        AR ( ≥ 2 Subjects)    ARs* Occurring During or    Within 72 Hours of Infusion        Number (%) of Subjects          (n=49)    Number (Rate*) of ARs (n=2264 Infusions)        Local reactions‡    49    (100)    1322    (0.584)        Other ARs:            Headache    12 (24.5)    32 (0.014)          Diarrhea    5 (10.2)    6 (0.003)          Fatigue    4 (8.2)    4 (0.002)          Back pain    4 (8.2)    5 (0.002)          Nausea    4 (8.2)    4 (0.002)          Pain in    extremity    4 (8.2)    6 (0.003)          Cough    4 (8.2)    4 (0.002)          Vomiting    3 (6.1)    3 (0.001)          Abdominal    pain, upper    3 (6.1)    3 (0.001)          Migraine    3 (6.1)    4 (0.002)          Pain    3 (6.1)    4 (0.002)          Arthralgia    2 (4.1)    3 (0.001)          Contusion    2 (4.1)    3 (0.001)          Rash    2 (4.1)    3 (0.001)          Urticaria    2 (4.1)    2 ( <  0.001)        * Excluding infections.† Rate of ARs per infusion.‡ Includes injection-site reactions as well as bruising, scabbing, pain,irritation, cysts, eczema, and nodules at the injection site.    The ratio of infusions with ARs, including localreactions, to all infusions was 1303 to 2264 (57.6%). Excluding localreactions, the corresponding ratio was 56 to 2264 (2.5%).Table 3 summarizes injection-site reactions based oninvestigator assessments 15 to 45 minutes after the end of the 683 infusionsadministered during regularly scheduled visits (every 4 weeks).Table 3: Investigator Assessments* of Injection-SiteReactions by Infusion, US Study        Injection-Site Reaction    Number† (Rate‡) of Reactions (n=683 Infusions§)        Edema/induration    467    (0.68)        Erythema    346 (0.51)        Local    heat    108 (0.16)        Local    pain    88 (0.13)        Itching    64 (0.09)        * 15 to 45 minutes after the end of infusionsadministered at regularly scheduled visits (every 4 weeks).† For multiple injection sites, every site was judged, but only the site withthe strongest reaction was recorded.‡ Rate of injection-site reactions per infusion.§ Number of infusions administered during regularly scheduled visits.    Most local reactions were either mild (93.4%) or moderate(6.3%) in intensity.No deaths or serious ARs occurred during the study. Twosubjects withdrew from the study due to ARs. One subject experienced a severeinjection-site reaction one day after the third weekly infusion, and the othersubject experienced moderate myositis. Both reactions were judged to be “atleast possibly related” to the administration of Hizentra.European StudyIn a clinical study conducted in Europe, the safety ofHizentra was evaluated for 10 months (3-month wash-in/wash-out period followedby a 7-month efficacy period) in 51 subjects with PI who had been treatedpreviously with IGIV every 3 or 4 weeks or with IGSC weekly. Subjects weretreated with Hizentra at weekly median doses ranging from 59 to 267 mg/kg bodyweight (mean: 118.8 mg/kg) during the wash-in/wash-out period and from 59 to243 mg/kg (mean: 120.1 mg/kg) during the efficacy period. The 51 subjectsreceived a total of 1831 weekly infusions of Hizentra.Table 4 summarizes the most frequent ARs (experienced byat least 2 subjects) occurringduring or within 72 hours after the end of aninfusion. Local reactions were assessed by the subjects between 24 and 72 hourspost-infusion. The investigators then evaluated the ARs arising from thesubject assessments.Table 4: Incidence of Subjects with Adverse Reactions(ARs)* (Experienced by 2 or More Subjects) and Rate per Infusion, EuropeanStudy        AR ( ≥ 2    Subjects)    ARs* Occurring During or    Within 72 Hours of Infusion        Number    (%) of Subjects      (n=51)    Number    (Ratet) of ARs      (n=1831    Infusions)        Local reactions‡    24    (47.1)    105    (0.057)        Other ARs:             Headache    9    (17.6)    20    (0.011)          Rash    4 (7.8)    4 (0.002)          Pruritus    4 (7.8)    13 (0.007)          Fatigue    3 (5.9)    5 (0.003)          Abdominal    pain, upper    2 (3.9)    3 (0.002)          Arthralgia    2 (3.9)    2 (0.001)          Erythema    2 (3.9)    4 (0.002)          Abdominal    discomfort    2 (3.9)    3 (0.002)          Back pain    2 (3.9)    2 (0.001)          Hematoma    2 (3.9)    3 (0.002)          Hypersensitivity    2 (3.9)    4 (0.002)        * Excluding infections.† Rate of ARs per infusion.‡ Includes infusion-related reaction; infusion-site mass;infusion/injection-site erythema, hematoma, induration, inflammation, edema,pain, pruritus, rash, reaction, swelling; injection-site extravasation, nodule;puncture-site reaction.    The proportion of subjects reporting local reactionsdecreased over time from approximately 20% following the first infusion to < 5% by the end of the study.Three subjects withdrew from the study due to ARs of mildto moderate intensity. One subject experienced injection-site pain andinjection-site pruritus; the second subject experienced injection-site reaction,fatigue, and feeling cold; and the third subject experienced injection-sitereaction and hypersensitivity. All reactions were judged by the investigator tobe “at least possibly related” to the administration of Hizentra.Biweekly (Every Two Weeks) Or Frequent (2 To 7 Times per  Week) DosingNo data regarding ARs are available for these alternativeHizentra dosing regimens because no clinical trials using these regimens wereconducted; however, it is unlikely that the safety profile is qualitativelydifferent from that of weekly dosing.Postmarketing ExperienceBecause postmarketing reporting of adverse reactionsis voluntary and from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possibleto reliably estimate the frequency of these reactions or establish a causalrelationship to product exposure.HizentraThe following adverse reactions have been identifiedduring postmarketing use of Hizentra.This list does not include reactionsalready reported in clinical studies with Hizentra [see Clinical Trials Experience above].  Infusion reactions: Allergic-anaphylactic reactions such    as swollen face or tongue and pharyngeal edema, pyrexia, chills, dizziness,    hypertension/changes in blood pressure, malaise.,Cardiovascular: Chest discomfort (including chest    pain),Respiratory: Dyspnea,Neurological: Tremor, burning sensation	empty

Radiesse (Calcium Hydroxylapatite Gel Filler for Wrinkle Reduction)	Necrosis was generally preceded by pain and blanching of    the skin at the time of injection accompanied with stinging or tingling and    bruising, redness, and swelling.

Treatment for necrosis generally    consisted of a combination of nitroglycerin ointment/vasodilatation, ibuprofen,    acetaminophen, or aspirin, antibiotics, steroids, non-steroidal wound treatment    ointment and warm compresses. For cases where information was available,    patients had recovered or were recovering with minimal to no scarring at last    contact. Few cases required consultation with a plastic surgeon and possible    excision and revision surgery to correct the defect resulting from the    necrosis.,Allergic Reaction was identified by itchiness and severe    swelling, including swelling of the face and tongue. Onset ranged from    immediately after injection to 2 days after injection. Allergic reaction was    generally treated with anti-histamines and steroids. Some cases required    hospitalization. All patients recovered from the allergic reaction with no    permanent adverse outcome.,Serious edema has been reported with an onset ranging    from 1 day to 3 weeks (inflammation related to nodule formation). Treatment    generally consisted of administration of antibiotics, anti-histamines and    steroids. In some cases patients sought treatment in an emergency room or were    hospitalized. Generally events resolved within 1 to 2 days but a few patients    have been reported as having intermittent edema or persistent edema related to    a reoccurring infection. For cases where information was available, most    patients have recovered or are recovering.,Infection, often identified as cellulitis, was    accompanied by swelling, hardened areas, redness, pustules, and pain. Onset of    infection ranged from 1 day to 2 months and generally lasted 2 days but, in one    case, persisted for 6 months. Infections were generally treated with    antibiotics. For cases where information was available, patients had recovered or    were recovering. Few patients experienced scarring that may require corrective    surgery or discoloration at the site of the infection.	empty

Restylane (Hyaluronic Acid Dermal Filler Gel)	Hypersensitivity reactions ranging from moderate to    severe mostly occurred within 1 to 2 days of implantation and up to 3 weeks.    Reported symptoms included swelling; itching on chest and back; puffy, burning,    watery, and itchy eyes; and shortness of breath. Treatments included steroids, diphenhydramine,    unspecified intravenous medication, oxygen and various creams. An evaluation of    patients who reported potential hypersensitivity reactions did not demonstrate any    evidence of IgE or cell mediated immunologic reactions specifically directed at    hyaluronic acid. Most hypersensitivity events resolved within 1 to 14 days with    or without treatment.,Allergic reaction and anaphylactic shock: Eight patients    experienced immediate post-injection reactions which included extreme swelling    of lips and the whole face. Two of these patients had symptoms of hypersensitivity    and one patient experienced anaphylactic shock and presented with shortness of    breath, headache, nausea and vomiting. These patients had to be admitted to the    emergency room or were hospitalized for immediate medical interventions. Delayed      hypersensitivity: Two patients developed symptoms of hypersensitivity 7-10    days after injection. One patient experienced severe erythema and swelling in    the lips and all over her face to the point that her eyes were shut and the    other had swelling of the lips accompanied by dyspnea, lymphadenopathy,    peripheral and laryngeal edema.,Vascular accidents and necrosis: In 5 patients, skin    discoloration, bruising, and blanching was seen immediately post-injection due    to vascular accidents. The lesions later turned into necrosis and in some cases    remained as scarring or dark spots. One example was a patient who had a “mustache-like”    mark above her lips, even after receiving treatments. Later, one patient in    this group developed hard bumps in her upper lips that looked like  “granulomas.”,Infection/Abscess: Serious abscess formations ranging    from moderate to severe occurred in eleven patients. Onset ranged from 3 days    to one week with an average duration of approximately one month to resolution.    Symptoms included swelling, redness, pain and hard nodules. Five patients    required hospitalization for incision and drainage (I&D) and intravenous    (IV) antibiotic therapy. Cultures for all patients ranged from gram positive    staphylococcal, gram negative cellulitis, apathogen streptococci, gram positive    cocci infection, polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) with no bacteria and    positive proprionibacterium malassezia. The remaining cultures were either negative    or not reported. Treatment included various antibiotics and steroids in some    cases.	empty
